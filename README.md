# Ardunio IoT with MQTT

In this repository please find a library for MQTT use from Arduino (forked from https://github.com/hirotakaster/MQTT/). There are also examples for using the package with the RedBear Duo *DuoWifiMQTTBasic). Be sure to have this example compiling before you come to class. This example will be modified during class to adopt a JSON protocol. I will run an MQTT broker from a computer during class.
