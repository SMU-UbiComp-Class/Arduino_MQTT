# Ardunio IoT with MQTT

In this repository please find a library for MQTT use from Arduino (forked from https://github.com/hirotakaster/MQTT/). There are also examples for using the package with the RedBear Duo *DuoWifiMQTTBasic). Be sure to have this example compiling before you come to class. This example will be modified during class to adopt a JSON protocol. I will run an MQTT broker from a computer during class. 


You can also look at archived code that was made for the RedBear WiFi mini that I use in the videos for the class. They are under the _archive folder. These will NOT  work with the Duo (without a slight amount of manipulation to the existing code).
